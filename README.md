This tool allows you to create, delete and reorder tasks with simple hotkeys.
Personally for me the vertical position means task's priority and horizontal means it's status.

## Keys

* `+` - add task
* `-` - remove task
* `right arrow` - switch to next column
* `left arrow` - switch to previous column
* `Shift + right` - move task to next column
* `Shift + left` - move task to previous column
* `Enter` - start editing task's text
* `Esc` - stop editing task's text
